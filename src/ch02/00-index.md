# Development and Debugging

- Game development is a highly iterative process
  - you want to try out different ideas
  - your vision and goal may change
  - you may encounter unexpected behaviors or bugs
- You want a developing procedure that frees you from the fear of making changes or mistakes
- We can make this happen as early as possible, like now
